# AirportControlSystem
This program simulates an airport control system using priority queues to manage plane requests for landing, takeoff, and emergency situations.
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- numpy
1. Clone the repository:
   https://github.com/liakopal/AirportControlSystem.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd airport-control-system
3. Install the required packages:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage
Run the program with the command:
python PriorityQueue.py

The program will start generating plane requests and processing them based on their priority. Emergency requests are processed first, followed by landing requests, and finally takeoff requests.
